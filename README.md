# Visualization-of-Collaborative-Learning-Networks-Using-igraph
This project analyzes and visualizes collaborative learning networks using Python’s iGraph library. It models learners as nodes and their interactions as edges to reveal collaboration patterns, key participants, and community structures, helping improve teamwork and learning effectiveness through visual insights.
